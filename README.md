## Background: 
Tasked with contributing insights to the New Zealand Police Department, the objective was to unravel patterns in vehicle thefts and enhance community safety.

## Key Goals: 
1. **Keep People Safe:**
- Identify when and where vehicle thefts are most likely to occur.
- Develop awareness messages to caution people during high-risk times and in specific areas.

2. **Assist Law Enforcement:**
- Provide actionable insights to optimize resource allocation.
- Enable targeted efforts in areas where thefts are more prevalent, improving response efficiency.

## Insights & Impact:
**Objective 1: Identify Peak Times for Vehicle Thefts** 

Analysis of theft data revealed an increase during the New Zealand summer, with Mondays and Tuesdays emerging as high-risk days. This understanding guides the planning of safety campaigns for effective communication.

**Objective 2: Vehicle Types, Age, Luxury vs. Standard, and Color Analysis**

Examination of vehicle demographics showcased station wagons as the most targeted. Additionally, patterns connecting vehicle types, colors, and theft incidents were observed, such as a higher incidence of silver and grey vehicle thefts.

**Objective 3: Regional Analysis on Population and Density**

A regional analysis disclosed that Auckland, with its high population, experiences the most thefts. Surprisingly, areas with significant population density, like Nelson, showed fewer thefts. This knowledge aids law enforcement in focusing efforts where they can make the most impact.

This analysis contributes valuable insights to the New Zealand Police Department, promoting a proactive approach to address vehicle thefts and enhance safety within the community.
